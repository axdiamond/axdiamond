    title: Hi, my name is Andrew Diamond
    summary: |
      I have been playing with computers for most of my life, from modding Civ4, to now developing complex systems that are used across the world. I am familiar with microcontrollers, network administration, web applications, distributed systems, and scalability. And this familiarity, from the wires to the web server, shines through in my development. 

      Outside of work, I enjoy the outdoors, cooking, team-based video games, and I am usually training in some form of martial art. To keep my mind active, I listen to books and podcasts on software engineering, communication, start-ups, and economics.
