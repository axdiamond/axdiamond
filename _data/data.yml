career-profile:
    title: My Name Is Andrew Diamond
    summary: |
      I've loved computers from an early age. From modding my Civ4 games, to developing complex systems that are used across the world. I'm familiar with microcontrollers, network administration, web applications, distributed systems, and scalability. My understanding of all of this, from the wires to the web server, shine through in my development.

      Teamwork is important to me. I highly value the opinions of everyone, and make it a point to take the time to assist anyone with a question, even if its something I dont know. I like to think I improve the overall productivity of my team.

      Outside of work; I enjoy the outdoors, cooking and baking, and competitive team-based video games. I listen to books and podcasts on software engineering, communication, start-ups, and economics. And I am usually training in some kind of martial arts.
